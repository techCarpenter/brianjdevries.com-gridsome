- Cold showers
  - start small (short)
  - consistency
  - resilience
  - Just do it, don't anticipate it
  - acquaint yourself with discomfort

If you know what your plan is, it's straight forward to execute in the moment:  
i.e. When I'm at the end of my shower, I will turn the knob to its coldest for 1 minute.

There's a time for everything (planning, taking action, listening, speaking, war, peace, etc.)

- Start small
  - It's like a muscle that hasn't been exercised
- Set your default (i.e. If I want to hit the snooze button, I will go to the bathroom and splash my face with cold water.)
- implement systems
- work on consistency
